Comprehensive Brand & Styling Guidelines
1. Logo
Text: The logo is the word "fabulinus" in lowercase.
Font: It uses an extra-bold, prominent font (font-extrabold).
Color: The logo is rendered in the primary brand accent color, a bright red (text-red-400).
Size: It is displayed at a text-2xl size to ensure visibility without overpowering the navigation.
2. Header
Position & Behavior: The header is a "sticky" or "fixed" element that remains at the top of the page (fixed top-0) to provide persistent navigation. It sits above all other content (z-50).
Layout: It uses flexbox (flex) to align the logo on the left and the navigation links on the right (justify-between).
Appearance: The header has a clean, modern look with a bg-white background, a subtle shadow-lg, and soft, rounded-b-3xl bottom corners.
Desktop Navigation: Links are displayed horizontally (hidden md:flex) with space-x-6 for comfortable spacing.
Mobile Navigation: On smaller screens, a menu icon appears. The navigation menu drops down vertically, aligned to the right (flex flex-col items-end), ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience.
3. Footer
Layout: The footer is organized into a three-column grid on larger screens, which stacks into a single column on mobile devices. Content within each section is centered.
Color Scheme: It features a dark theme with a bg-gray-900 background and text-white for primary text, creating a clear visual separation from the main content.
Content: It is divided into three distinct sections: "Quick Links" for navigation, "Follow Us" with social media icons, and "Contact Us" with email and phone information.
Links: Footer links use a text-white color with a hover:text-red-400 effect, maintaining brand consistency even in the dark theme.
Decorative Elements: Subtle, animated blobs are used in the background with a low opacity (opacity-10) to add visual interest without distracting from the content.
4. Typography & Text
Font Smoothing: All text is antialiased for a crisp, smooth appearance across all browsers and devices.
Heading Hierarchy:
Primary Headings (H1): Large, impactful, and extra-bold (text-4xl to text-7xl, font-extrabold, leading-tight). They often feature a color-highlighted word (text-red-400) for emphasis.
Secondary Headings (H2): Slightly smaller but still prominent, using a font-semibold weight (text-2xl to text-5xl).
Section Titles (H3): Bold and clear (text-xl to text-3xl, font-bold).
Body Text: Paragraphs are set at a readable size (text-lg to text-2xl) with a relaxed line height (leading-relaxed) for optimal legibility.
Text Color: The primary body text is a dark gray (text-gray-800) for strong contrast against the white background. Secondary or descriptive text uses a lighter gray (text-gray-600 or text-gray-700).
5. Color Palette
Primary Accent: Bright Red (text-red-400, text-red-600) used for the logo, links, key headings, and calls-to-action.
Backgrounds:
Main: bg-white.
Hero/Feature Areas: A soft gradient from light red to orange (from-red-50 to-orange-100).
Footer: Dark Gray/Black (bg-gray-900).
Text:
Standard: Dark Gray (text-gray-800).
Muted: Light Gray (text-gray-600).
On Dark: text-white.
6. Animations & Interactivity
On-Scroll Animations: Content gracefully fades and slides into view (animate-fadeInUp) as the user scrolls down the page.
Hover Effects: All interactive elements, including links and buttons, feature smooth transition effects for color and size (hover:scale-105), providing satisfying visual feedback.
Decorative Animations: Gentle, looping animations like animate-blob and animate-gradientShift are used to add a dynamic, premium feel to key sections.

7. Tagline
Style: The text is not italic or bold.
Text: Express. Communicate. Dominate.
Color: The main text is white on dark backgrounds and black on light backgrounds. All periods in the tagline are in the primary accent color (text-red-400).
